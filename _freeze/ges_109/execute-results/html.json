In the chunk below we modify the data by joining the various data frames provided in the package to help you get started with the analysis.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nunvotes <- un_votes |>\n  inner_join(un_roll_calls, by = \"rcid\") |>\n  inner_join(un_roll_call_issues, by = \"rcid\", relationship =\n  \"many-to-many\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n## UN voting patterns\n\nLet's create a data visualisation that displays how the voting record of the UK & NI changed over time on a variety of issues, and compares it to two other countries: US and Turkey.\n\nWe can easily change which countries are being plotted by changing which countries the code above `filter`s for. Note that the country name should be spelled and capitalized exactly the same way as it appears in the data. See the [Appendix](#appendix) for a list of the countries in the data.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n## References\n\n1.  David Robinson (2017).
